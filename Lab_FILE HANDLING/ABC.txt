THis code effectively reads a file named "ABC.txt" and prints its contents line by line to the screen.
 1)By using a with statement, it ensures the file is properly managed and closed after reading.
 2) The loop processes each line individually.
 3) The print function displays each line without adding extra newlines, thereby preserving the fileâ€™s      original format. 
This method is straightforward and efficient for handling text files and displaying their contents.
