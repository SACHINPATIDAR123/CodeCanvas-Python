# Q1. Write a program for Airthmetic Operators.

"""
Airthmetic operators are used between two operands to perform airthmetic operations (Mathematical Operations).
Airthmetic operators are as follows:
"""

# ADDITION (+) : It adds two operands.
number1 = 10
number2 = 15
addition_result = number1 + number2
print("Addition:",addition_result)

# SUBTRACTION (-) : It subtracts the second operand from the first operand.
number1 = 45
number2 = 65
subtraction_result = number1 - number2
print("Subtraction:",subtraction_result)

# MULTIPLICATION (*) : It multiplies two operands. 
number1 = 25
number2 = 65
multiplication_result = number1 * number2
print("Multiplication:",multiplication_result)

# DIVISION (/) : It divides the first operand by the second operand and returns quotient.(Returns float value)
number1 = 564
number2 = 44
division_result = number1 / number2
print("Division",division_result)

# MODULUS (%) : It returns the reminder after dividing the first operand by the second operator.
number1 = 456
number2 = 45
modulus_result = number1 % number2
print("Modulus:",modulus_result)

# EXPONENTIATION (**) : It calculates the first operand's power to the second operand.
number1 = 9
number2 = 5
exponentiation_result = number1 ** number2
print("Exponentiation:",exponentiation_result)

# FLOOR DIVISION (//) : It divides the first operand by the second operand and returns quotient.(Returns floor value)
number1 = 564
number2 = 44
floordivision_result = number1 // number2
print("Floor Division:",floordivision_result)
